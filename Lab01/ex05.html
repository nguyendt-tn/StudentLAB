                From <i>Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits,</i> by
                Benedict Carey, published in the <i>New York Times </i>on

            <h2 class="style5"><b>Alternate study environments</b></h2>
            <p>
                Study in the library,in the coffee shop,in your room,…Varying
                the place you study helps you remember more.
            </p>
            <h2 class="style5"><b>Mix content</b></h2>
            <p>
                Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some this again, some of the
                other. Switching content helps you remember more.
            </p>
            <h2 class="style5"><b>Space study sessions</b></h2>
            <p>
                Three one-hour sessions is more effective than one three-hour
                session.
            </p>
            <h2 class="style5"><b>Self-testing</b></h2>
            <p>
                Test yourself,or have a buddy do it.It helps you know how well
                you know.
